    <h2>Extremely easy and perfect for any event!</h2>
        <p>Tiramisu is really a timeless (or it is season-less?) dessert, don't you think? On that note and with the holidays coming, everything about us having to adapt, appreciate and celebrate with smaller clans, here is a recipe that I really think would be useful. A tiramisu for two, it's eggless and the small batch helps us avoid food waste.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ladyfingers</li>
                    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>Instant coffee</li>
                    <li>Sugar</li>
                    <li>Cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>Mascarpone</li>
                    <li>Whipping cream</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add mascarpone cheese and sugar into a bowl. Whisk until fluffy using a handheld whisk. Now add in vanilla extract and whipping cream. Continue whisking until you get a thick stiff cream. Don't over mix to avoid splitting. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix water, coffee and sugar in a wide flat container until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Soak ladyfingers in the coffee for a few seconds and arrange at the bottom of 2 glasses of 1 cup (250 ml). Dust with cocoa powder. Spoon and divide half of mascarpone mixture into the glasses. Repeat with more ladyfingers and the rest of the cream.</li>
            <li>Serve directly. Optional - chill in the fridge for 1- 2 hours for a firmer texture. Dust the top with cocoa powder right before serving.</li>
        </ol>
