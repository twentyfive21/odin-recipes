## Below is a short explanation of the languages for any beginners out there! If you have any questions or tips please reach out to me! I would appreciate any feedback to help me learn more. 

## HTML stands for hypertext markup language and is used as the foundation to define the structure of webpages. To explain it in simpler terms it is the beams that hold up your house. It is used to create your paragraphs, headings, footers, and so much more.

## CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it is used to style your webpages. For example, it is the color of your walls and the decorations you have around your house. This is the language that brings your site to life and makes it look beautiful. CSS alters the size of your font, background color, and so much more. Without this your page ends up looking like you created it in microsoft word.

## This Webiste has a index.html page which is the homepage. Then there are also 3 additional pages that include recipes. I hope this simple example helps someone out there who is beginning their journey and please reach out if you have any questions.
